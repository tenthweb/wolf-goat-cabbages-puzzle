        <h2>The Wolf, Goat, and Cabbbage Problem</h1>
        <p> The wolf, goat and cabbage problem is a very old logic puzzle. The earliest known version was included in a book of puzzles by the medieval monk Alcuin of York. </p>
        <p>Care to test your wits against it?</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p> The goal of the puzzle is to move the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage across the river - the boat can only carry one of them at a time. The wolf will eat the goat if they are left together, and the same is true if the goat and the cabbages are left together. </p>
        <p> Click the animals and vegetables on the riverbank to move them to the boat, and click the boat to move it across the river. Then move the cargo to the bottom bank. </p>
        <p> (Click anywhere to return) </p>
